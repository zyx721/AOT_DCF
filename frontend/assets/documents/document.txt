# Iftar Ramadan Fundraising Campaign - Algeria
## "Breaking Fast, Building Community"

### **Campaign Overview**

The **Iftar Ramadan** initiative represents a nationwide humanitarian effort designed to provide nutritious meals to Algeria's most vulnerable populations during the sacred month of Ramadan in 2025. Beyond simply addressing hunger, this campaign embodies the core Islamic values of charity (zakat) and community solidarity (ummah) that are central to Ramadan observance.

Our vision extends beyond merely providing food—we aim to create moments of dignity, connection, and spiritual nourishment for those facing economic hardship across Algeria's diverse regions, from bustling urban centers to remote rural communities.

### **Background & Need**

Algeria continues to face economic challenges that have intensified food insecurity for many families. Recent government statistics indicate that approximately 23% of households in Algeria experience some form of food insecurity, with this percentage increasing during Ramadan when food prices typically rise by 15-20%.

Last year's similar initiative served 7,500 meals across three cities. Based on community feedback and increasing need, we've expanded our 2025 campaign to encompass five major cities with a target of 10,000 meals.
